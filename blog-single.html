            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>Today’s advanced threats require a new set of email security features in addition to traditional
                capabilities. A multi-layered approach to email security ensures protection for business communications.
                Businesses need a next-gen email security solution that offers comprehensive threat prevention
                capabilities.</p>
            <h1>The increased importance of next-gen email security</h1>
            <p>Email has become the most critical vector for an assortment of threats, both inbound and outbound. Cyber
                threats are evolving rapidly from mass spam attacks to advanced forms of targeted attacks. Most of these
                attack campaigns use email as the choice vehicle to deliver the payload. According to an Annual Threat
                Report, ransomware use grew by 167 times year-over-year and is the payload of choice for malicious email
                campaigns. However, traditional email security is not equipped to handle advanced threats such as
                ransomware and zero-day attacks. Today, you need a next-gen email security solution.</p>
            <h1>Critical capabilities of next-gen email security</h1>
            <p>Most anti-virus solutions are signature-based and therefore ineffective against advanced threats such as
                ransomware and unknown malware. These types of malware are uniquely hashed and undetectable using
                traditional techniques. Hence, a sandbox environment is required to detect and prevent ransomware and
                zero-day attacks before they even reach your network.</p>

            <div class="blog-email-security">
                <p><i>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                        the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                        but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining.

                    </i></p>
            </div>
            <h1>Phishing protection</h1>
            <p>Phishing campaigns have emerged as a top vehicle to deliver payloads for ransomware attacks. Your email
                security solution must incorporate advanced content analysis that scans every email subject, body and
                attachment and leverage a sandbox environment for suspicious attachments. In addition, the solution must
                maintain a real-time dynamic IP blacklist list to filter emails with malicious links.</p>
            <h1>Fraud Protection</h1>
            <p>Hackers use advanced tactics such as spear phishing, whaling and CEO Fraud to solicit Personal
                Information or to carry out scams by impersonating and crafting emails that appear to be authentic.
                Granular configurations for email settings must be available to prevent illegitimate messages from
                entering your organization. Mail configurations such as SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (Domain Keys
                Identified Mail) and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance), together
                with pattern recognition and content analysis, enforce proper validation on all incoming messages.</p>

            </h1>
            <ul class="listing">

                    <i>Why do we use it?</i>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Data Loss Prevention</h1>
            <p>Traditional email security solutions rely on static IP reputations and signature based detection
                mechanisms, which simply cannot protect against today’s evasive and sophisticated malware. Detection
                alone does not suffice; often notifications are useless to prevent an ongoing attack. There is a need
                for email security solutions to move from detection to prevention and have the ability to stop attacks
                before they even reach your network. Next-gen email security solutions use a multi-layer defense
                approach with sandbox technology and In addition, it delivers superior anti-phishing, anti-spoofing,
                anti-spam, multi-engine AV and data loss prevention (DLP) for comprehensive protection. To learn more,
